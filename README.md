# Bootstrapping - An Explorable Explanation

*A submission for the fifth Stanford CS109 Probability for Computer Scientists Contest!*

This is meant to be an explorable explanation that people can use to learn about bootstrapping and run quick interactive experiments.

Check it out [here](https://greentfrapp.github.io/bootstrapping-explorable/)!
